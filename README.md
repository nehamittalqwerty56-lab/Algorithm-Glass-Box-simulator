# GlassBox Simulator – Algorithm Visualization Tool

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional algorithm learning treats algorithms as black boxes, making it difficult for beginners to understand how decisions are made internally.

## 💡 Solution
GlassBox Simulator is an interactive web-based tool that visualizes how search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A* explore a grid step-by-step, making algorithm logic transparent and easy to understand.

## 🚀 Features
- Visual comparison of BFS, DFS, and A*
- Step-by-step traversal animation
- Adjustable speed control
- Beginner-friendly UI

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- A* Search (Heuristic-based)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- VS Code
